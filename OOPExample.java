// OOP: Where we deal with Class and Object
// 4 main concepts:

// 1. Encapsulation:
// Bundling of properties(fields) and behaviors(methods) into single unit is called encapsulation.
// That single unit is nothing but a class
// We use this to achieve data hiding

// 2. Inheritance:
// Acquiring properties and methods of another class is called inheritance
// We use this to avoid duplicate code
// There are 3 types of inheritance allowed
// Single / Multilevel / Hierarchical
// Java doesn't support multiple inheritance due to ambiguity
// Because multiple classes can have same named properties or methods
// So which method to call on runtime, how to know?

// 3. Polymorphism:
// Having more than one form is called polymorphism.
// There 2 types of polymorphism
// Compile time and Run time
// We can achieve compile time polymorphism by method overloading.
// We can achieve runtime polymorphism by method overriding.
// Basically it allows methods to do different things based on object
// it is acting upon, even though method signature is same.

// 4. Abstraction:
// Hiding out internal details of a class is called abstraction.
// Basically we don't care how it works, but we are interested in what it can do.
// Hiding implementation details.
